# Advertising Budget Optimization and Sales Prediction  Using Regression Model

This project analyzes an advertising dataset containing the monthly advertising expenditure across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels along with corresponding increases in product sales. The objective is to build a predictive model that estimates the expected increase in sales based on advertisement spending and to uncover insights that help businesses optimize their marketing budgets.

Using regression techniques, the project performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature correlation study, and model development using multiple ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.). Each model is evaluated and fine-tuned to identify the best-performing approach. The analysis also highlights which advertising channels have the highest impact on sales, enabling companies to make informed decisions on where and how much to invest to maximize return on investment (ROI).
